garmin-connect-export
=====================

Download a copy of your Garmin Connect data, including stats and GPX tracks.

Description 
-----------
This script(Python3) will backup your personal Garmin Connect data. All downloaded data will go into a directory called `YYYY-MM-DD_garmin_connect_export/` in the current working directory. Activity records and details will go into a CSV file called `activities.csv`. GPX files (or whatever format you specify) containing track data, activity title, and activity descriptions are saved as well, using the Activity ID.

If there is no GPS track data (e.g., due to an indoor treadmill workout), a data file is still saved. If the GPX format is used, activity title and description data are saved. If the original format is used, Garmin may not provide a file at all and an empty file will be created. For activities where a GPX file was uploaded, Garmin may not have a TCX file available for download, so an empty file will be created. Since GPX is the only format Garmin should have for every activity, it is the default and preferred download format.

If you have many activities, you may find that this script crashes with an "Operation timed out" message. Just run the script again and it will pick up where it left off.

Usage
-----
You will need a little experience running things from the command line to use this script. That said, here are the usage details from the `--help` flag:

```
$ python3 gcexport3.py --help
usage: gcexport3.py [-h] [--archive ARCHIVE] [--username [USERNAME]]
                    [--password [PASSWORD]] [-c [COUNT]] [-e [EXTERNAL]]
                    [-a [ARGS]] [-f [{gpx,tcx,original}]] [-d [DIRECTORY]]
                    [-u] [-w [WORKFLOWDIRECTORY]]
                    [--delete [DELETE [DELETE ...]]] [--debug] [--verbose]
                    [--version]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --archive ARCHIVE     path with filename to create/append an archive
  --username [USERNAME]
                        your Garmin Connect username (otherwise, you will be
                        prompted)
  --password [PASSWORD]
                        your Garmin Connect password (otherwise, you will be
                        prompted)
  -c [COUNT], --count [COUNT]
                        number of recent activities to download, or 'all'
                        (default: 1)
  -e [EXTERNAL], --external [EXTERNAL]
                        path to external program to pass CSV file too
                        (default: )
  -a [ARGS], --args [ARGS]
                        additional arguments to pass to external program
                        (default: )
  -f [{gpx,tcx,original}], --format [{gpx,tcx,original}]
                        export format; can be 'gpx', 'tcx', or 'original'
                        (default: 'gpx')
  -d [DIRECTORY], --directory [DIRECTORY]
                        the directory to export to (default: './YYYY-MM-
                        DD_garmin_connect_export')
  -w [WORKFLOWDIRECTORY], --workflowdirectory [WORKFLOWDIRECTORY]
                        if downloading activity(format: 'original' and
                        --unzip): copy the file, given a friendly filename, to
                        this directory (default: not copying)
  -u, --unzip           if downloading ZIP files (format: 'original'), unzip
                        the file and removes the ZIP file
  --delete [DELETE [DELETE ...]]
                        list the .types you want deleted before the archive is
                        created. Example --delete .csv .json.
  --debug               turn on debugging log
  --verbose             increase output verbosity
  --version             print version and exit                  


Examples:
`python3 gcexport3.py --count all` will download all of your data to a dated directory.

`python3 gcexport3.py -d ~/MyActivities -c 3 -f original -u --username bobbyjoe --password bestpasswordever1` will download your three most recent activities in the FIT file format (or whatever they were uploaded as) into the `~/MyActivities` directory (unless they already exist). Using the `--username` and `--password` flags are not recommended because your password will be stored in your command line history. Instead, omit them to be prompted (and note that nothing will be displayed when you type your password).

`python3 gcexport3.py -d ~/MyActivities -c 3 -f original -u --username bobbyjoe --password bestpasswordever1  --workflowdirectory c:\hotfolder --unzip --delete .json` same as above, but  additionally copy the files additionally to `c:\hotfolder` directory for postprocessing. Then delete the temporary json files.

Alternatively, you may run it with `./gcexport3.py` if you set the file as executable (i.e., `chmod u+x gcexport3.py`).

Of course, you must have Python installed to run this. Most Mac and Linux users should already have it. Also, as stated above, you should have some basic command line experience.

Data
----
This tool is not guaranteed to get all of your data, or even download it correctly. I have only tested it out on my account and it works fine, but different account settings or different data types could potentially cause problems. Also, because this is not an official feature of Garmin Connect, Garmin may very well make changes that break this utility (and they certainly have since I created this project).

If you want to see all of the raw data that Garmin hands to this script, just print out the contents of the `json_results` variable. I believe most everything that is useful has been included in the CSV file. You will notice some columns have been duplicated: one column geared towards display, and another column fit for number crunching (labeled with "Raw"). I hope this is most useful. Some information is missing, such as "Favorite" or "Avg Strokes."  This is available from the web interface, but is not included in data given to this script.

Also, be careful with speed data, because sometimes it is measured as a pace (minutes per mile) and sometimes it is measured as a speed (miles per hour).

Garmin Connect API
------------------
This script is for personal use only. It simulates a standard user session (i.e., in the browser), logging in using cookies and an authorization ticket. This makes the script pretty brittle. If you're looking for a more reliable option, particularly if you wish to use this for some production service, Garmin does offer a paid API service.

History
-------
The original project was written in PHP (now in the `old` directory), based on "Garmin Connect export to Dailymile" code at http://www.ciscomonkey.net/gc-to-dm-export/ (link has been down for a while). It no longer works due to the way Garmin handles logins. It could be updated, but I decided to rewrite everything in Python for the latest version.

My base code was copied from:
Original author: Kyle Krafka (https://github.com/kjkjava/)
Date: April 28, 2015
Fork author: Michael P (https://github.com/moderation/)

I have added --verbose, --delete, --debug, and --archive  switches to cut down on the printed output and automatically remove the .JSON and .CSV files keeping only the .fit output files. The scripts have also been moved into submodules 

Contributions
-------------
Contributions are welcome, particularly if this script stops working with Garmin Connect. You may consider opening a GitHub Issue first. New features, however simple, are encouraged.
